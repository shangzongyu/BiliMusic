## Vision

BiliMusic is not just a simple video player wrapped in a desktop shell. Its goal is more specific: take the huge, loose, title-noisy, music-rich universe of Bilibili and shape it into something that feels like a real desktop music app.

Video titles are cleaned before lyric search. Search results become music-like track lists. Creator pages can be browsed like artist pages. Queues, favorites, recent tracks, and playlists gradually become a local library. The interface leans toward Apple Music: calm, translucent, animated, and refined, while still staying efficient as a desktop tool.

The project is also a cross-platform experiment. Besides regular Electron desktop packaging, it includes a HarmonyOS PC Electron project under `platform/HarmonyOS` with dedicated adaptations for tray behavior, native title buttons, frameless windows, fullscreen player interactions, and resource packaging.

## Experience Highlights

### 1. Feels Like a Music App

- Discover, recommendations, search, playlists, and settings share one visual language.
- Page transitions, card hover states, player expansion, and lyric movement are animated.
- The bottom player stays compact, while the expanded player becomes immersive.
- Covers, background glow, rotating discs, and animated lyrics work together as one listening scene.

### 2. Turns Bilibili Videos Into Music

- Search Bilibili videos.
- Search users and browse creator spaces.
- Browse discovery, recommendations, and music rankings.
- Convert video results into a unified track model that works with queue, playlists, favorites, and history.

### 3. Built for Long-Term Listening

- Recently played tracks are recorded automatically.
- Favorite tracks have their own library page.
- Custom playlists are persisted locally.
- Playlists can be imported and exported as JSON.
- Playback queue and state are restored after restart.

### 4. Deep Desktop Integration

- Electron main process proxies Bilibili and lyric API requests.
- Closing the main window minimizes to tray.
- Tray state follows current playback.
- Packaging is configured for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- HarmonyOS PC resources can be synced and prepared for HAP builds.

## Feature Map

### Search

The search page is designed as a music discovery surface, not just an input box:

- Video search and user search.
- Apple Music style result rows.
- User results can open creator-space browsing.
- Dedicated empty, loading, and error states.
- Each track supports play, play next, add to queue, and add to playlist.

### Recommendations and Discovery

- Recommendation page uses Bilibili music-related content.
- Discover page aggregates ranking-like content.
- Hero sections use cover art as the visual anchor.
- Track lists stay dense, readable, and quick to scan.

### Player

The bottom player includes:

- Play / pause.
- Previous / next.
- Shuffle.
- Repeat modes.
- Seekable progress.
- Volume and mute.
- Queue drawer.
- Add current track to playlist.
- Expand into the immersive player.

The immersive player includes:

- Large cover art and dynamic background.

- Lyric panel with manual lyric matching.
- Fullscreen toggle.
- Close to tray.
- Collapse back to the main interface.

### Lyrics

Bilibili titles often contain noisy words such as official MV, full version, cover, live, high quality, and more. BiliMusic processes titles before lyric search:

- Removes common video-title noise.
- Extracts quoted and bracketed candidate titles.
- Removes upload descriptions, collections, rankings, and livestream hints.
- Builds multiple search candidates.
- Scores lyric candidates by title similarity, artist, album, and duration.
- Caches both successful and failed matches.
- Supports manual lyric search and version selection.

### Playlists

- Create playlists from the sidebar.
- Configure playlist name and description.
- Playlists appear under the playlist area and in the playlist overview page.
- Tracks from any page can be added through a reusable modal.
- Playlist detail pages support play all, delete playlist, remove one track, and batch remove.
- Batch selection is only shown in edit mode to keep the default interface clean.

### Queue

- View the current queue.
- Current track has a live equalizer indicator.
- Add queued tracks to playlists.
- Remove one track from the queue.
- Enter selection mode for batch removal.

### Settings

The settings page follows a macOS / Apple Music preference style:

- Light / dark / system theme.
- Expanded / collapsed / automatic sidebar.
- Playback quality.
- Auto play.
- Lyric display.
- Download directory.
- Download quality.
- Playlist import and export.
- Account status and QR login entry.

## Interface Design

BiliMusic aims to be expressive without becoming noisy.

### Frontend Layer

- `pages/` contains route-level pages.
- `components/` contains player, lyrics, queue, layout, and shared UI.
- `contexts/` manages playback, auth, now-playing, and add-to-playlist state.
- `services/` encapsulates Bilibili data, lyric matching, and local library storage.
- `hooks/` provides settings, theme, and lyric state logic.

### Electron Layer

- The main process registers Bilibili API, lyric API, and window-control IPC handlers.
- A custom `app://` protocol is used in production to avoid ESM/CORS issues under `file://`.
- Tray and main-window lifecycle are managed in the main process.
- `preload.cjs` exposes a limited bridge to the renderer.

### HarmonyOS PC Layer

- `scripts/prepare-harmony.mjs` syncs build outputs into the HarmonyOS project.
- `scripts/build-harmony.mjs` tries to run Hvigor to build a HAP.
- `platform/HarmonyOS/web_engine` contains HarmonyOS Electron adaptation code.
- HarmonyOS-specific behavior is guarded by `process.platform === "openharmony"`.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- npm.
- A matching OS environment for desktop packaging.
- DevEco Studio and the HarmonyOS Electron environment for HarmonyOS PC builds.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Start Electron

```bash
npm run electron:start
```

## Desktop Packaging

```bash
npm run electron:build
```

Artifacts are written to:

```text
release/
```

Configured targets:

- Windows: NSIS installer.
- macOS: DMG and ZIP.
- Linux: AppImage and DEB.

## HarmonyOS PC

The HarmonyOS PC Electron project is located at:

```text
platform/HarmonyOS
```

### Prepare Resources

```bash
npm run harmony:prepare
```

This command:

1. Runs `npm run build`.
2. Clears the previous HarmonyOS app resource directory.
3. Copies `dist/`.
4. Copies `dist-electron/`.
5. Writes a minimal runtime `package.json`.

Target directory:

```text
platform/HarmonyOS/web_engine/src/main/resources/resfile/resources/app
```

### Build HAP

```bash
npm run harmony:build
```

If `hvigor` or `hvigorw` is unavailable in your shell, open:

```text
platform/HarmonyOS
```

in DevEco Studio and run:

```text
Build -> Build Hap(s)/APP(s) -> Build Hap(s)
```

## Persistence

BiliMusic stores:

- Current track.
- Playback queue.
- Playback progress.
- Volume, mute, shuffle, repeat.
- Recently played tracks.
- Favorites.
- Custom playlists.
- Lyric cache and manually selected matches.
- Theme and settings.
- Basic logged-in user display information.

Storage locations:

- `localStorage`: frontend state, library data, playlists, lyric cache.
- Electron `userData`: desktop data such as downloads.

## Development Notes

### Title Cleaning and Lyric Matching

Lyric matching lives in `src/services/lyrics.ts`. It performs:

- Unicode normalization.
- Common video-noise removal.
- Quoted-title extraction.
- Upload-description, collection, ranking, and livestream hint removal.
- Multiple keyword generation.
- Candidate scoring by similarity, artist, album, and duration.

### Playback State

Playback state lives in `src/contexts/PlayerContext.tsx`:

- Queue.
- Current track.
- Playing state.
- Volume.
- Progress.
- Shuffle and repeat.
- Auto play.
- Tray state sync.

### Playlists

Playlist behavior is split across services and UI:

- `src/services/playlists.ts` persists playlist data.
- `Sidebar` creates playlists.
- `AddToPlaylistContext` provides the reusable add modal.
- `Playlists` handles overview, detail, and batch editing.

### Window Strategy

Window behavior lives mainly in `electron/main.ts`:

- Regular platforms use custom window buttons.
- HarmonyOS PC uses native title buttons.
- Closing the window hides it to tray.
- Production loads the renderer from `app://local/index.html`.
- The immersive player requests native title buttons to be hidden.

## Roadmap

- [ ] More complete local download management.
- [ ] Configurable lyric sources and fallback.
- [ ] More accurate Bilibili audio-quality selection.
- [ ] Editable playlist covers.
- [ ] Listening statistics.
- [ ] Mini player.
- [ ] Further HarmonyOS PC behavior refinement.
- [ ] More complete automated tests.

## Contributing

Issues, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome. This project is strongly experience-driven, so UI quality, motion, cross-platform behavior, lyric matching, and stability all matter.

Before submitting changes, at least run:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you changed HarmonyOS resources or adapters:

```bash
npm run harmony:prepare
```

Then rebuild and verify in DevEco Studio.
